CodeGen

I only see that functions and not constructors have NamedCExp and names inside them

There are some secret options for that (would be nice if they weren't hidden):
           MkOpt ["--dumpcases"] [Required "output file"] (\f => [DumpCases f])
              Nothing, -- dump case trees to the given file
           MkOpt ["--dumplifted"] [Required "output file"] (\f => [DumpLifted f])
              Nothing, -- dump lambda lifted trees to the given file
           MkOpt ["--dumpanf"] [Required "output file"] (\f => [DumpANF f])
              Nothing, -- dump ANF to the given file
           MkOpt ["--dumpvmcode"] [Required "output file"] (\f => [DumpVMCode f])
              Nothing, -- dump VM Code to the given file


Compiler:

They rely on the names of data and type constructors for ExtSTG. But ANF does not contain all the defined datatypes of an Idris program. (edited)

My first approach was solely rely on ANF, it didnt work, because case expressions in ANF matched against constructors not defined in ANF.

I think i have an hypothesis why constructors are eliminated. They seem to be compiled away with dead code elimination. Only the ones used to instantiate varibles remain
